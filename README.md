# Sunshine 

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course Developing Android Apps.

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

##Project Overview

In this project, you will build a wearable app for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device.

Why this Project?

Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into usersâ€™ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.
What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

    Understand the fundamentals of Android Wear.
    Design for multiple watch form factors.
    Communicate between a mobile device and a wearable device.
